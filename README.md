# Animal Behavior and Genetic Analysis Code Repository 
This repository contains the supplementary code for our manuscript titled "Genetic and Evolutionary Insights into Panic-related Escape Behaviors in Ovine Animals." The code is organized into four main sections:

## 1. Running and Jumping Trajectory Analysis and Phenotype Calculation 
This folder contains the code used for analyzing running and jumping trajectories derived from high-speed videos of locomotion tests. The data were processed using DeepLabCut (DLC) for trajectory tracking, and subsequent analysis was performed to calculate running speed and jumping height.  
﻿ 
## 2. Random Forest Modeling 
This section includes the code used for random forest modeling to identify significant associations between morphological features and locomotion performance.  
﻿ 
## 3. GWAS and Haplotypes Analysis 
This folder contains the code used for Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) and haplotype analysis.  
﻿ 
## 4. Mouse Behavior Experiments 
This section includes the code used for analyzing behavioral data from gene-edited mice experiments.
